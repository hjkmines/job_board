(Cipher Tech), we take great pride in supporting some of the most mission critical work in the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. The majority of our company is comprised of extremely talented engineers and developers who write production tools in direct support of one of two missions: digital forensics and malware reverse engineering.\n Digital forensics is the practice of extracting and processing evidence from computers, phones, tablets, cameras, flash-drives, and just about any other form of digital media. The results of our work are then used to support federal and military law enforcement, counterintelligence, and counter-terrorist activities.\n Malware reverse engineering is the practice of analyzing, oftentimes extremely advanced, malicious code. The goal of a reverse engineer is to understand how the malicious code works and determine facts such as: how did it infect the victim's computer, what kind of information it is seeking to steal, how is it communicating with the author (actor), and who that actor might be working for.\n Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion\n Cipher Tech is an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer.
