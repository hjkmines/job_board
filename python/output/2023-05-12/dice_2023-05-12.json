For five years running, we have been nominated by our employees as either finalists or winners of the Best Places to Work award. We are known for our family-like environment, insanely good benefits, and extra-mile attitude.   Suppose our core values of treating each other like family, being mission-focused, giving back, and being intrepid (you know, just a little bit fearless!), resonate with you. In that case, you'll probably make an excellent addition to our team.   The Hours   Most of our positions are salaried, but that doesn't mean we expect you to work crazy hours from sun-up to sun-down. Forty hours per week is standard, and while sometimes we push a little harder during big projects, we've established a flexible-hours policy to help even out that extra time within a given two-week pay period. Work-life balance is important to us, which is why we offer generous accrual of paid personal leave to use for anything you wish, and you won't lose the value of your leave (no use-it or lose-it here!).   The Benefits   Most people who know anything about Intrepid know about our benefits, especially our 401k program. We don't offer a match (gasp!). That's right, no match. That's because we will contribute to your 401k whether you donate to it or not. We'll put 14% of your bi-weekly pay into your account no matter what you do. Plus, you're going to want to retire with us; that 14% will grow like a weed while invested in our low-fee index funds provided by Fidelity. And the cherry on top, your financial advisors are already paid for! Schedule a one-on-one and watch them create the best plan for your retirement goals.   In addition to our incredible retirement plans, we also provide one of the best health insurance plans on the market through Blue Cross Blue Shield. Intrepid covers most of the premium costs, and our employees get incredibly low deductibles, just $200 per year! Additionally, we provide all employees and their families with a free, on-call telemedicine doctor to help with easily diagnosable illnesses.   We'll also provide you, your spouse, and dependents with complimentary life insurance and low-cost dental, vision, disability, critical illness, and pet insurance. Plus, you'll have the opportunity to set aside pre-tax dollars into an FSA for medical and dependent care expenses. We'll even provide a $1000 scholarship to your newborn or adopted child and any children who are enrolled in higher education!   It sounds like a lot, but we believe our employees are worth the investment!   The Perks   Sure, you'll have access to the usual perks like corporate discounts on dining, entertainment, and gyms, but we also like to have fun. As an employee, you'll be a VIP at all our annual events like our Chili Cook-Off, Thanksgiving, Lunch & Lawn Games, Ice-Cream Social, Intrepig BBQ, team events, and last but certainly not least, our big end-of-year Christmas bash complete with amazing prizes\/gifts! We employ a lot of remote workers too, so if you fall into that category, you'll get special opportunities to engage virtually in many of our events as well as some that are exclusive to you!   Give Back   As we said above, giving back is one of our core values here at Intrepid. Our employees have big hearts for our communities, and we all come together annually to give away tens of thousands of dollars through our employee-managed charitable fund, the Intrepid Ideal Community Fund (ICF). We help organizations that are passionate about helping people including groups that provide flu shots and soup kitchens for the homeless, health and education services for underprivileged children, and who provide additional support for the disabled. If you like to get your hands dirty, we offer several volunteer opportunities throughout the year; cleaning trails, serving food, writing cards to nursing home shut ins, etc. Everyone can play a role in giving back! Our mission is to create ideal communities wherever we live, and our vision of a perfect community is one where the needs of every citizen are met.   Join Us!   If you're excited by the benefits, blown away by all the perks, and inspired by our values and mission then we are excited to meet you! The best way to start your journey as an Intrepid employee is to apply today. We can't wait to hear from you!   #CJReport this jobDice Id: 91102422Position Id: 1748579767","date":"2023-05-09T00:02:28","country":"US","state":"AL","city":"Huntsville","zip":"35801","remote":false,"source":"dice"},{"title":"Junior C# Application Developer","company":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.dice.com\/jobs\/detail\/Junior-C%23-Application-Developer-General-Dynamics-Information-Technology-Hanover-MD-21076\/bayfeed\/20648_RQ141777","description":"PERKS:A Relocation package may be available for this position  General Dynamics Information Technology has an immediate opening for an Application Developer.
