Think immigrants in the US who send money to their families back home.\n\nTraditional money transfer companies charge hefty fees to send money. The World Bank reports that remitters lose 6% today to fees and exchange rate markups.\n\nPomelo fixes this by using the power of credit. Instead of sending cash overseas, consumers in the US can apply for our Pomelo Mastercard and give their loved ones overseas access to their credit \u2014\u00a0for free.\n\nInstead of charging our customers, we make money from interchange, like most other credit cards. This puts money back in the hands of the people who need it most \u2014\u00a0our customers.\n\nWe have a host of other benefits, like making money transfer safer too (no more carrying or picking up cash), and helping immigrants build their credit when they don\u2019t have great credit today. Read more about us here:\n\n\u2022 Our website, particularly our FAQs\n\u2022 Our launch blog post from our founder & CEO\n\nAs of August 2022, we\u2019re a distributed\/remote team of ~20, and we\u2019re hiring across the US. We\u2019ve raised $20M in venture capital to date (along with a $50M warehouse facility), and our investors include Keith Rabois (former COO of Square), Kevin Hartz (co-founder of Xoom), The Chainsmokers, and The Weeknd!\n\nWe\u2019re hiring\n\nWe\u2019re a small team of <10 engineers today, and we\u2019re looking for 2-3 more engineers to join us on our journey. We\u2019re still early-stage, so if working on a small team with lots of ownership, responsibility, and impact excites you, keep reading. =)\n\nOur tech stack today is primarily:\n\n\u2022 Java, Postgres, and AWS on the backend\n\u2022\u00a0TypeScript, React, and React Native on the frontend\n\nWe care less about experience with these specific technologies and more about experience building, shipping, and iterating on production apps and services in general.\n\nWe\u2019re similarly open to both engineers who specialize in backend or frontend and engineers who prefer to work full-stack; our goal is to build a diverse team with complementary skill sets.\n\nThe work\n\nRegardless of specialization, you\u2019ll be given major problems to solve, and significant ownership in solving them. Examples of problems you might get to work on include:\n\n\u2022\u00a0\ud83d\udcc8 Growth. Deeply understand our end-to-end acquisition funnel, work with our peers in product and marketing to identify opportunities for impact, and then make them happen! Success is measured directly through conversions and retention.\n\n  \u21aa Recent examples here include shipping a web version of our signup flow (originally mobile-only), iterating on our credit underwriting model (to expand access to our product), and building out a significant promotional exchange rates feature (making us significantly better than the market).\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u2728 Quality and delight. Our success as a company will be determined in large part by the quality of the product we provide to our customers and how delighted we make them feel. (Word of mouth is the number one way most money transfer services spread.) What feedback are we hearing from customers and customer service? Where are we falling short, and where can we go above and beyond?\n\n\u00a0\u21aa Recent examples here include integrating with a courier service in the Philippines for fast and reliable card delivery overseas, and implementing an international security standard (3DSecure) for immediate \u201cvirtual card\u201d support (our first magic moment).\n\n\u2022\u00a0\ud83d\udee0 Infra and tools. We take pride in our craft, and we value our time, so we regularly build infrastructure and tooling that makes us more effective or saves us time.\n\n\u00a0\u21aa Recent examples here include a whole internal admin app for customer support and operations (we use Retool for this today), analytics & experimentation infra to let us test, measure, and learn (we use Segment, Mixpanel, and LaunchDarkly today), and continuous deployment infra for our website (automatically shipping to production on every merge to main, with preview deployments on every PR).\n\nWe work in cross-functional \u201csquads\u201d and collaborate both within and outside of eng. We operate in sprints and try to ship and demo something meaningful every week. And besides daily standups and weekly all-hands, we try to leave most time unscheduled, so the focus can be on the work and the problems above.\n\nThe requirements\n\nWe know that women and minorities read lists of requirements and consider themselves unqualified if they don\u2019t meet every single one.\n\nSo rather than list every possible thing we might want to see, below are the things that are most important to us:\n\n\u2022\u00a0Genuine interest in our mission, and genuine desire to have real-world impact. We\u2019re too small and early today to support engineers who are only interested in deep technical problems, for example.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Ability and readiness to work in an early-stage startup. You have experience working in ambiguous environments, defining or clarifying requirements yourself. You\u2019ve taken initiative and ownership in solving problems, not just implementing solutions.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Solid technical proficiency in your area of expertise. You\u2019re capable of independently building meaningful apps or services, and have experience shipping and iterating on them in production.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Effective communication and collaboration skills. You\u2019re able to clearly convey technical concepts and tradeoffs to non-technical audiences, and you have past experience working with others outside of engineering.\n\nAll of the above is more important to us than specific years of experience, but we expect most engineers to need at least a few years in the industry to gain this experience.\n\nWe\u2019re open to both mid-level engineers (e.g. 2-4 years of experience) and more senior engineers (e.g. 5+ years of experience) today. We hope to support engineers earlier in their career in the future as we grow.\n\nOur culture and values\n\nWe\u2019re a fintech startup, and we\u2019re a remote-first company. These things have shaped our culture and values. Below are our values:\n\n1.\u00a0Earn the trust of our customers. As a startup, our customers come first, and as a fintech startup, their trust in us is paramount. We don\u2019t take the opportunity to serve them for granted.\n\n2. Be relentless. Startups are hard and filled with adversity. We persevere through challenges, focus on impact, and strive to always be shipping, learning, and improving.\n\n3. Integrity in every language. We strive to always do what\u2019s right, both for ourselves and for our customers around the globe.\n\n4. Show your work. Successful teams run on trust, and proactive transparency builds trust. We love holding ourselves accountable by openly sharing our progress, and we love empowering engineers by openly sharing business context. We also document extensively, to help us work remotely more effectively.\n\n5. Leadership at every level. We want every engineer to own whole problems and feel empowered to go wherever those problems take them. We also aim to lift others up and make others better.\n\nBenefits and perks\n\nHere are the biggest things we believe we have to offer:\n\n\u2764\ufe0f A truly meaningful mission and an opportunity for direct social impact. We\u2019re aiming to put real money back in the hands of the people who need it most and help immigrants and their families realize the American dream.\n\n\ud83d\udc65 An amazing team and culture (see our values above). You\u2019ll have peers from both top tech companies (e.g. Google, Twitter, Microsoft) and other successful startups (e.g. Affirm, Remitly, MemSQL). We\u2019ll both empower you and challenge you to do great work, in a great environment, alongside great people.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffd Opportunity for direct experience, learning, and growth. You won\u2019t be a cog in a wheel here; you\u2019ll be given major problems to solve and the ownership to solve them. Whether you hope to start your own startup someday or become a more capable engineer, the experience you gain here will help you achieve your career goals faster.\n\nWe hope you join us for those reasons and not for money, prestige, or the allure of working at a startup. Startups are hard, and success for an early-stage startup like us may still be years away.\n\nFortunately, we also value enjoying the journey, so we also happily offer:\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Competitive salary.\u00a0You won\u2019t be sacrificing significant cash to take a bet on us. We also calibrate our salaries to the market to prevent wage gaps for women and minorities.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Significant equity. Successful companies in our space are valued at billions of dollars, so our upside potential is high. If you\u2019re excited to bet on us, we\u2019re excited to share in the rewards if we succeed.\n\n\ud83c\udfe5 Platinum-level health insurance (medical, dental, vision) \u2014 with 99% covered by the company for you and 50% for dependents.\n\n\ud83c\udf34 Real, guaranteed PTO (we don\u2019t say \u201cunlimited\u201d PTO then make you feel bad for taking any): 3 weeks in your first year, 4 weeks thereafter. We even go a step further and offer a\u2026\n\n\u2708\ufe0f $1,500 annual travel stipend \u2014 to encourage you to take time off and truly disconnect and recharge. You have no excuse not to now. =)\n\n\ud83d\ude0c $300 annual wellness stipend, to help you stay physically, emotionally, and mentally healthy, any way you choose.\n\n\ud83d\udda5 $500 home office setup stipend, to help you do great work. This is in addition to us already providing things like a top-of-the-line laptop and monitor on us.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa Twice-a-year company retreats, with potentially more frequent engineering team meetups, covered by the company. We\u2019ve found this to be a great way to spend in-person time together while still getting the benefits of working remotely otherwise.\n\nNext steps\n\nIf all of the above sounds exciting to you, we encourage you to apply! You have nothing to lose, and we\u2019ll get back to you quickly.\n\nIf we move forward, our typical interview process is as follows:\n\n1. 30-minute recruiter call. We\u2019ll get to know each other at a high level, cover logistics and expectations, and answer any general questions you may have!\n\n2. 30-minute manager call. We\u2019ll dig more into your technical background and values, and answer any engineering-related questions you may have.\n\n3. 1-hour collaborative coding exercise. This\u2019ll be with a Pomelo engineer over screenshare. This\u2019ll be a data structures problem, but we don\u2019t do fancy or tricky algorithms; this problem tries to be real-world.\n\n4. 3-4 hour virtual onsite! You\u2019ll get to meet more of our team, and a typical interview loop covers system design\/architecture, cross-functional collaboration, and values alignment \u2014\u00a0no whiteboard coding.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!\n","link":"https:\/\/jobs.lever.co\/Pomelo\/15121f26-ed9e-4b6b-9f6e-c1684a9e1bfc\/","remote":false,"location":"San Francisco, CA","date":"2022-06-14T13:15:50","source":"lever"},{"title":"AI Software Systems Engineer","company":"Zoox","description":"This is an opportunity to join the Software Systems Engineering team to participate in building the Zoox robotaxi, the first in the world that has operated on public roads.
