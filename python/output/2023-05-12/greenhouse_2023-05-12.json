We want to create a future where construction workers don't need to retire early because their bodies give out. In Dusty's future, the buildings we live and work in are built by teams of creative and problem-solving construction crews who direct robots to do the dull\/dirty\/dangerous work.\nWhat We're Building:\nDusty bridges the gap between the digital world of building design with the skilled labor operating in the field, accelerating the digital transformation of the construction industry. The centerpiece of our strategy is the FieldPrinter: a mobile printer-on-wheels that prints building floorplans full-size on the concrete floor of a construction site. When errors in layout can cause multi-million-dollar mistakes, our product ensures that all field crews are building off of a single source of truth derived from the digital model.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLlNbd0G3UvxcPBCG_u6F5JsHHrwPKzAWvWhat you\u2019ll do\nDusty is seeking a software developer with a background in construction, BIM modeling and automation to develop Revit and AutoCAD plugins that translate building models into a layout format that the FieldPrinter robot can print.\nIn this role, you\u2019ll be a member of Dusty\u2019s software development team, developing a critical part of the overall FieldPrinter product in collaboration with other engineers, product managers and product designers and participating in our software development process.

Faraday gets a break and gains apprenticeship with Davy, and shortly thereafter (partially) blows himself and Davy up in a nitrogen trichloride explosion.\nWe think Davy\u2019s sacrifice was worth it, though, since Faraday went on to do experimental work in the field of electromagnetism that is foundational to innumerable modern technologies.
